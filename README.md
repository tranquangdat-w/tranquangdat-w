# TranQuangDat

Just a guy trying to push my brain to the limit, write fast code, bend tools to my will, and craft beautiful software that runs like magic

Fun Facts

- I write most of my code live, sleep-deprived, and heavily caffeinated
- Neovim > any IDE, fight me  
- Arch Linux user. btw
- Most of my repos are just experiments… until they’re not.  

## Currently Building

- A faster way to write code (tooling, plugins, or mindset)
- A personal knowledge base that doesn’t suck
- Better habits, maybe. Eventually. Possibly.

## Side Quest
- Reading CS books I'll never finish
- Making Open Source that’s actually useful

**Come for the code, stay for the chaos.**
